# Remarks for Students

There is so much to study when you are studying to become an engineer. What are
the most important areas to study? How should you prioritize? How do you balance
your studies with the need to earn a living, tend to your family, etc.?

The answers to these questions, while straightforward, are not simple. They
depend, as most deep questions depend, on your life situation, your values, and
your interests--in short, on who you are. Regardless of natural ability, work
ethic, or interest, a financially independent student with a strong background
in mathematics and no family responsibilities will find it far easier to pursue
studies in theoretical computer science than the single parent with a
high-school education struggling to pay rent or a mortgage. So fully
appreciating the reality of who you are is perhaps the most important thing to
be keep in mind when thinking through these questions.

## Areas of Study

What you should study depends on what you want to do. If you don't know exactly
what you want to do, and all you know is that you enjoy programming and suspect
software engineering would suit you, then a broad approach is probably best. If
you have the time and resources, the obvious route is to start with an
introductory computer science class at a college and see where it takes you.
